In my short time there, I've already contributed to over a dozen projects and assisted with managing one project for one of the firm's long-time clients. \nPrior to this role, I completed a two-year internship with Mobile First, where I honed my mobile app development skills. Ideally, I would like to continue to specialize in mobile software engineering, an area where I know your firm excels.",
